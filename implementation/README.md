# Implemenation

`Implementation` is not actually an algorithm. However, `implemenation` base 
typed problems occasionally occur in the algorithm test. Typical type
of `implementation` problems are those appear to be able to solve it
but actually quite difficult to implement by code. 

We will concentrate of `Brute-force` and `Simulation` for this chapter. 

> Brute-force : Calculating every possible number of cases to solve a problem.

> Simulation : Solving step by step in a way the problem is defined.
