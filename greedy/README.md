# Greedy Algorithm
> Greedy : 탐욕적인

Greedy Algorithm is an algorithm that chooses the best choice in each selection. 
In other words, `Locally Optimal Solution` leads to `Globally Optimal Solution`.

Here are some well-known problems of Greedy Algorithm :     
_Activity Selection Problem, Minimum Spanning Tree, Fractional Knapsack Problem, Huffan Codes, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Shortest Path from Single Source_
